I am an independent software developer. Except TextNut, I am the creator of [geniuswiki](http://www.geniuswiki.com), an open source web-based WIKI software. You may know markup writing is the fundamental concept of WIKI. I am absolutely a markup(not only Markdown) writing enthusiast. That is why I made TextNut. I am also working in a startup as CTO to develop the whole stack IT system, which most base on Django, MongoDB, Redis, Bootstrap, AngularJS and Java etc.
