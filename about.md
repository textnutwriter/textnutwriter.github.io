Except TextNut, I am the creator of [geniuswiki](http://www.geniuswiki.com), an open source web-based WIKI software. You may know markup writing is the fundamental concept of WIKI. Definitely, I am a markup (not only Markdown) writing enthusiast. That is why I made TextNut. 

TextNut is my first OS X application.  My major expertise is web development. [Geniuswiki](http://www.geniuswiki.com) is a Java based web system. In my current startup, I am in charge of the full stack production line. The small part is written by Java, C and Golang. Most is Python based. For front end, I use AngularJS, BootStrap, Jquery etc. In backend, I heavily adopt Python, Django, Redis, MongoDB and MySQL. More than that, I manage 10+ Amazon EC2 servers which are running various services for internal an external purpose.  

My technical radar is expanding to Swift, Rust and Docker, I hope have chance to use them in my next project.
