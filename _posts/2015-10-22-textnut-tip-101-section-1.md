### Tip 1/101
Task can have sub-tasks. It is just like a list, just by `TAB` to increase level of task or `SHIFT-TAB` to decrease. In an empty task item, typing `ENTER`, it is back to normal paragraph if it is already at first level of task, otherwise, it goes one level up.

### Tip 2/101
It has a popover if mouse is hovering the small icon beside document outline title. It includes the document outline (headings 1...6) and tags. These are clickable to relocate the document. This can be used to quickly locate the document even it is not open.

### Tip 6/101
`ESC` is helpful if you want to resume to normal typing style when current style is bold, strong, or cross etc. At typing `ESC`, it has a small popover menu, typing `ENTER`, then your current writing text will resume to normal font without any styling.

### Tip 7/101
At ordered or unordered list, when typing `CTRL+ENTER`, it continues the list but in a new line. More than that, using `TAB`, the consequence lines can be joined into the list.

### Tip 8/101
In rich mode, put `**` before a word, then move caret to the end of the word and typing `**`. The word will be bolded. Similar, try put `###` at a line beginning, that line turns into level 3 heading. That is another way to format text.

### Tip 9/101
The text can be copied into HTML, by shortcut `ALT-CMD-C`. In normal paste, styling text will parsed, any markdown syntax supported text will be converted to markdown text. So if you paste **bold** and *emphasis* into rich editor, it remains formats, if paste into markdown mode, it will be parsed to markdown text. Using shortcut `ALT-CMD-V` to avoid this conversion.

### Tip 10/101
Library is self-managed container for your documents. The document can contains images. In next major version, Library will support iCloud synchronisation. `Linked External Folder` is any folders in your MAC, most scenario is using this feature to manage files in your *Dropbox*.
