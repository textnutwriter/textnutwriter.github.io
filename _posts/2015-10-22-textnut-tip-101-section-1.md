### Tip 1/101
Task can have sub-tasks. It is just like a list, using `TAB` to increase level of task or `SHIFT-TAB` to decrease. In an empty task item, typing `ENTER`, it is back to normal paragraph if it is already at root level, otherwise, one level up.

### Tip 2/101
It shows a popover when mouse is hovering the small icon beside document outline title. It includes the document outline (headings 1...6) and tags. They are clickable and scroll the document to the anchor. This can be used to quickly locate the document even it is not open.

### Tip 5/101
To format text, after selecting text, just typing `*`, `**` or `~` etc. The text will be formatted to emphasis, strong or cross etc.

### Tip 6/101
`ESC` is helpful if you want to resume to normal typing style when current style is bold, strong, or cross etc. Typing `ESC`, it shows a small popover menu (only if current typing has styling), then `ENTER`, the current typing will resume to normal font without any styling.

### Tip 7/101
At ordered or unordered list, when typing `CTRL+ENTER`, it continues the list but in a new line. More than that, using `TAB`, the consequence lines can be joined into the list.

### Tip 8/101
In rich mode, put `**` before a word, then move caret to the end of the word and typing `**`. The word will be bolded. Similar, try put `###` at a line beginning, that line turns into level 3 heading. That is another way to format text.

### Tip 9/101
The text can be copied into HTML by shortcut `ALT-CMD-C`. When pasting, styling text will be parsed, any markdown syntax supported format will be converted to markdown. So if you paste **bold** and *emphasis* into rich editor, it remains formats, if paste at markdown mode, it will be parsed to markdown text. Using shortcut `ALT-CMD-V` to always paste as plain text.

### Tip 10/101
Library is self-managed container for your documents. The document can contains images. In future release, Library will support iCloud synchronisation. *Linked External Folder* is any folders in your MAC, the possible scenario is using this feature to manage files in your *Dropbox*.
