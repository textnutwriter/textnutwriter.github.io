### Tip 8/101
In rich mode, try to put `**` before a word, then move caret to the end of the word and typing `**`. You will found that word is bold. Similar, try put `###` at a line beginning, that line becomes level 3 heading. That is another way to format text.

### Tip 9/101
The text can be copied into HTML, by shortcut `ALT-CMD-C`. In normal paste,  rich formatted text will parsed, only valid markdown syntax formatting is supported. So if you paste **bold** and *emphasis* into rich editor, it remains formats, if paste into markdown mode, it will be parsed to markdown text. Using shortcut `ALT-CMD-V` to avoid this parsing.
